# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Working with Pull Requests

### Targeting a different base branch

If you opened a pull request against the wrong base branch (for example, `main`) but would prefer it to merge into another branch such as `v1`, you can update it without recreating the PR:

1. Open the pull request in your Git hosting provider (e.g., GitHub).
2. Locate the base branch selector near the top of the page. On GitHub this appears as `base: <branch-name>`.
3. Change the base from the current branch to `v1`.
4. Review the comparison view that appears. If the new base introduces merge conflicts, resolve them locally and push the fixes to your feature branch.
5. Once everything looks correct, save the change. The PR will now target `v1`.

If you are still creating the PR, simply choose `v1` as the base branch in the pull request form before submitting.
